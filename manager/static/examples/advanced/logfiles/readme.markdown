Logging Framework
================

* the Logging framework allows you to control what gets logged. there are three main abstractions. one is streams where it corresponds to one log. filters filter what the steam writes defaulting with one filter that logs everything. finally there are writers which are responsible for the output format default is ascii writer (tab-separated ASCII files)
