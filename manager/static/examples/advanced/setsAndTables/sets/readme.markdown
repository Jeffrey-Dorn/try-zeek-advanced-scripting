#Sets

in zeek sets are used to store unique elements of the same data type.

* in file 00 valid and invalid sets we use a variety of set operations to learn about what is a valid set and what is an invalid set 

* file 01 we explore how to add an element to a set using the add keyword

* file 02 we use simmilar operations that we used in file 00 but this time we use two valid sets.
