#Sets

in zeek sets are used to store unique elements of the same data type. because it is made for unique information it works great for thngs like ip adressed or ports 

* in file 00 valid and invalid sets we use a variety of set operations to learn about what is a valid set and what is an invalid set 

* file 01 we explore how to add an element to a set using the add keyword since sets only contain unique values we first check to make sure that the ip or port isnt currently in the set before we add it 

* file 02 we use simmilar operations that we used in file 00 but this time we use two valid sets.
