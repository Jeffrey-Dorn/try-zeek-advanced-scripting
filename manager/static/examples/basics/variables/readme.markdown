Variables
===========

You can assign arbitrary data to a variable in order to store it for later use.
A `local` variable differs from a `global` in that its 
scope is restricted to the body of a function 
and will be assigned its initial 
value each time the function body is executed. 

The reference on declaring variables, constants, functions etc is found 
[here](https://docs.zeek.org/en/current/script-reference/statements.html).
More on types and all things that can be declared will follow in later lessons of this
tutorial.

Run the example for this exercise. Try to print 'z' in the second event. Does that work?
